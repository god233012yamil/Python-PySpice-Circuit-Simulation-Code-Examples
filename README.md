# Introduction
PySpice is a Python module that provides bindings to the NgSpice circuit simulator. It allows you to define circuits, 
simulate their behavior, and analyze the results using Python's robust data analysis and visualization libraries.

This repository aims to provide a variety of examples to help you get started with PySpice and explore its capabilities. 
Each example is designed to highlight different aspects of circuit simulation, from basic resistor-capacitor circuits to 
complex transistor-based circuits.

# Installation
To run the examples in this repository, you must install Python and PySpice. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

2. Install PySpice: You can install PySpice using pip:
   pip install PySpice
3. Additional Dependencies: Some examples may require additional Python packages such as numpy and matplotlib for data
   analysis and visualization. Install them using pip:
   pip install numpy matplotlib

# Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PySpice-Circuit-Simulation-Examples.git

Navigate to the cloned repository:
